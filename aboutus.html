    <section>
        <p>The Eageles Wings Portmore Mentorship Programme was formed to connect youth in the Portmore community with caring adult mentors. 
            This is geared towards meeting the needs of youth who are falling through the cracks, eg. teenage mothers, substance abuse users,
            low performance in school, need to be motivated, among others. The programme offers a mixed modality of mentoring styles, such as traditional
            one-to-one mentoring, e-mentoring and team mentoring, to a populace ranging from ages 12-20 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our nation is currently in the midst of an unparallelled effort to accelerate self-confidence and self-awareness among our youth population.
            In this context, parents, school leaders and communities are looking for effective approaches to support learning, achievements and success for the youth.
            The development of the Eageles Wings Portmore Mentorship Programme is one of such approaches adopted to provide assistance and suppport through shared knowledge,
            skills, expertise and offering personal support. We are hoping that through joint activities, guidance, information and encouragement, the youth in Portmore will gain
            in character and begin setting positive life goals and further serve their community as role models.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Programme will make great strides to support the growth and development of the youth in our community. In doing so, we think it is imperative to form collaborative
            partnership with multiple stakeholders, including churches, schools and other organizations and professionals. Additionally, it is our opinion that a partnership will be
            a mutually supportive arrangement that can be beneficial for all involved. This will further instill a positive culture, improving relationships and reinforcing community
            involvement.
